The goal is to represent the input image as a fully connected and non-directional graph, and partitioned into multiple sets of segments that share some common characteristics such as color or intensity. The following techniques will be implemented:
<ul>
<li>Spectral Clustering.</li>
<li>Normalized cuts.</li>
<li>Recursive Normalized cuts.</li>
</ul>
</p> </div>
