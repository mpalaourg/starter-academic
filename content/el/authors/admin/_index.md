Hi there, my name is George Balaouras, and I am curious about everything, especially Data Science, Machine and Deep Learning. Currently, I am part of <a href="http://idt.iti.gr/">IDT LAB</a>, directed by <a href="https://www.iti.gr/~bmezaris/">Vasileios Mezaris</a>, a research team of <a href="https://www.iti.gr/iti/index.html">ITI/CERTH</a>, exploring automatic Video Summarization via Deep Learning techniques.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.auth.gr/en">Aristotle University of Thessaloniki</a> with a MEng degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My diploma thesis, titled <i>Data Collection and Analysis of Energy Consumption of Mobile Phones using Machine Learning Techniques</i>, was held in association with <a href="https://issel.ee.auth.gr/en/13-2/">Intelligent Systems & Software Engineering Labgroup (ISSEL)</a> under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://issel.ee.auth.gr/en/staff/andreas-l-symeonidis/">Andreas L. Symeonidis</a> and PostDoc Researcher <a href="https://issel.ee.auth.gr/staff/emmanouil-manos-tsardoulias/">Manos Tsardoulias</a>.
