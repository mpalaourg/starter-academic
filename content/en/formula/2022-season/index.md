The 2022 Formula 1 season brought significant changes with the introduction of new cars under the revised technical regulations. Surprisingly, **Mercedes** failed to meet expectations, struggling to maintain their dominant form. As a result, the battle for supremacy shifted between **Red Bull** and **Scuderia Ferrari**. However, **Ferrari**'s performance was marred by numerous mistakes, particularly in terms of strategy, revealing an area of weakness for the team. This allowed **Red Bull** and their driver **Max Verstappen** to seize control and secure both the Constructors' and Driver World Championship titles with relative ease in the second half of the season.

# Race Calendar
---
As displayed below, the 2022 Formula 1 season boasted an exhilarating race calendar comprising 22 races in 20 countries. Noteworthy inclusions were the return of the **Australian, Canadian, Japanese**, and **Singapore Grands Prix** after a two-year hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, certain races, such as the **Portuguese, Styrian**, and **Turkish Grands Prix**, were not part of the 2022 lineup. The **Qatar Grand Prix** also did not feature, with plans for its return in 2023. COVID-19 restrictions led to the cancellation of the **Chinese Grand Prix** for another year. The **Russian Grand Prix** faced initial suspension due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and was subsequently canceled. On a more positive note, the debut of the **Miami Grand Prix** added further excitement to the championship, offering fans a fresh and thrilling addition to the race calendar.
