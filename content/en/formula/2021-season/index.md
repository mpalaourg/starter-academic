Securing points by finishing within the top-10 is a significant milestone for both drivers and teams throughout the race weekend. Remarkably, every driver, excluding the **Haas** rookies **Mick Schumacher** and **Nikita Mazepin**, managed to score at least one point this season. **Lewis Hamilton, Lando Norris**, and **Carlos Sainz** emerged as the top point finishers across various tracks, accumulating a combined total of 20 point finishes, closely followed by **Max Verstappen** with 19. **Verstappen**'s teammate **Sergio Perez** consistently finished in the top-10, achieving this feat 16 times, while **Charles Leclerc** found himself sandwiched between the two **Red Bull** drivers with 18.

One of the newest features introduced in the 2021 Formula 1 season was Sprint Qualifying. This format involved a qualifying session on Friday that determined the grid for the Sprint Qualifying, with the result of the latter determining the starting grid for the Sunday race session. Three Sprint weekends took place at **Silverstone, Monza**, and **São Paulo**, where drivers finishing in the top-3 were awarded 3, 2, and 1 point respectively.

Based on the provided visualization, only five drivers reaped the benefits of the Sprint Qualifying sessions. Both **Valtteri Bottas** and **Max Verstappen** earned 7 points, while **Lewis Hamilton** managed to secure only 2. **Daniel Ricciardo** and **Carlos Sainz** were the other drivers who scored, albeit limited to a single point each. A particularly attention-grabbing moment occurred in Brazil when **Hamilton** started the Sprint Qualifying from the back of the grid but made a remarkable climb through the positions in the 24-lap race, ultimately finishing in 5th place. This performance was crucial for **Hamilton** to keep the championship title competition alive against **Verstappen**. However, **Hamilton**'s Sprint Qualifying success was marred by a subsequent 5-place grid penalty for the main race due to the use of an additional power unit element.

Additionally, **Daniel Ricciardo, Lando Norris**, and **Pierre Gasly** each achieved this feat once during the season, adding the accomplishment of being *the fastest driver* to their careers.

In the world of Formula 1, retirements are an inevitable part of the sport, whether due to mistakes or mechanical issues. Throughout the 2021 season, a total of 59 DNFs were recorded. Among these, 6 were attributed to accidents, while 20 were a result of collisions between drivers. The remaining retirements were caused by mechanical issues, most commonly involving gearboxes, brakes, or engine failures. Notably, **Nikita Mazepin** and **George Russell** experienced the highest number of retirements, both with six each. **Max Verstappen** faced three DNFs, including a high-speed tire blowout in the **Azerbaijan Grand Prix**, a collision with **Lewis Hamilton** at **Silverstone** resulting in a dramatic [51G crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIKel6jVD3Q), and [another collision with **Hamilton**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VSwwZYDW94) at the **Italian Grand Prix**. Despite these three retirements, **Verstappen** achieved an impressive 18 podium finishes in the 19 races he completed, demonstrating his remarkable consistency in securing top-three results whenever he reached the finish line. Interestingly, the **Italian Grand Prix** incident also marked the only retirement for **Hamilton** throughout the season. Notably absent from the figure provided is **Carlos Sainz** from **Ferrari**, who impressively completed all the races in the 2021 season without a single retirement.
