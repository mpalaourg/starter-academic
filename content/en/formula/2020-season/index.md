The 2020 Formula 1 season was significantly impacted by the global spread of the Covid-19 virus. The season, originally scheduled to begin in March, was postponed for several months until July. The first eight rounds of the Championship were held without spectators, and the remaining races were either run with limited capacity or behind closed doors due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The 2020 Formula 1 season witnessed several significant developments. The **Australian Grand Prix**, scheduled to be the season opener, was canceled just hours before the 1st FP session. Other notable cancellations included the **Vietnam Grand Prix at Hanoi Street Circuit** and the **Netherlands Grand Prix at Zandvoort**, which was set to return after a long hiatus of over 30 years.

Initially, the calendar featured eight European tracks, but as time progressed, more circuits were added. This included the inclusion of new tracks like **Mugello for the Tuscany Grand Prix** and **Algarve for the Portugal Grand Prix**. Additionally, iconic circuits such as **Nurburgring for the Eifel Grand Prix**, **Imola for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix**, and **Istanbul Park for the Turkey Grand Prix** were brought back.

An interesting aspect of the season was the hosting of multiple Grands Prix on the same track. This included **Red Bull Ring** hosting the **Austria Grand Prix** and **Styria Grand Prix**, **Silverstone** hosting the **Great Britain Grand Prix** and **70th Anniversary Grand Prix**, and **Bahrain** hosting the **Bahrain Grand Prix** and **Sakhir Grand Prix**.

Overall, the 2020 season comprised 17 Grands Prix, each with their details given below:
