The 2020 Formula 1 season was significantly impacted by the global spread of the Covid-19 virus. The season, originally scheduled to begin in March, was postponed for several months until July. The first eight rounds of the Championship were held without spectators, and the remaining races were either run with limited capacity or behind closed doors due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.

# Race Calendar

The 2020 Formula 1 season witnessed several significant developments. The **Australian Grand Prix**, scheduled to be the season opener, was canceled just hours before the 1st FP session. Other notable cancellations included the **Vietnam Grand Prix at Hanoi Street Circuit** and the **Netherlands Grand Prix at Zandvoort**, which was set to return after a long hiatus of over 30 years.

Initially, the calendar featured eight European tracks, but as time progressed, more circuits were added. This included the inclusion of new tracks like **Mugello for the Tuscany Grand Prix** and **Algarve for the Portugal Grand Prix**. Additionally, iconic circuits such as **Nurburgring for the Eifel Grand Prix**, **Imola for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix**, and **Istanbul Park for the Turkey Grand Prix** were brought back.

An interesting aspect of the season was the hosting of multiple Grands Prix on the same track. This included **Red Bull Ring** hosting the **Austria Grand Prix** and **Styria Grand Prix**, **Silverstone** hosting the **Great Britain Grand Prix** and **70th Anniversary Grand Prix**, and **Bahrain** hosting the **Bahrain Grand Prix** and **Sakhir Grand Prix**.

Overall, the 2020 season comprised 17 Grands Prix, each with their details given below:

# Drivers and Constructors

The grid consisted of 10 Teams and 23 Drivers, including 3 Reserve Drivers. In comparison to the 2019 season, there have been several notable alterations:

- In **Renault**, **Esteban Ocon** replaced **Nico Hülkenberg**.
- In **Williams**, **Nicholas Latifi** replaced **Robert Kubica**. Then, **Kubica** became the reserve driver for **Alfa Romeo**.
- **Toro Rosso** was re-branded as **AlphaTauri** with white and navy blue livery, and still using Honda Power Unit.
- **Mercedes AMG Petronas** adopted a black livery in 2020, deviating from their well-known silver one.

Throughout the season, **Nico Hülkenberg** was called by **Racing Point** three times during the season as a replacement for drivers who contracted Covid-19. Finally, **Jack Aitken** and **Pietro Fittipaldi** got their chances for their debuts in Formula 1.

# 2020 Season analysis
---
Among the 17 tracks, **Lewis Hamilton** stands out with the highest number of wins, including an impressive 5-win streak from the **Eifel GP** to the **Bahrain GP**. His teammate **Valtteri Bottas** has also crossed the finish line in first place twice, contributing to **Mercedes AMG Petronas**' total of 13 wins. **Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen** achieved 2 victories, while **Pierre Gasly** secured a memorable win for **AlphaTauri** in the **Monza GP** and **Sergio Perez** clinched a win for **Racing Point** in the **Sakhir GP**.

Furthermore, pole-sitters successfully defended their positions in 10 different tracks, with **Hamilton** leading the way with 8 successful defenses. Additionally, in 5 tracks, the race winners also set the fastest lap, earning the maximum available points. Notably, **Pierre Gasly**'s victory came from the 10th position on the starting grid, following a red flag and a penalty that reshuffled the field. Finally, the **Bahrain GP** saw an extraordinary moment when [**Romain Grosjean**'s horrific accident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YMjw2sjXqU) occurred on lap 1, leading to a red flag that halted the race for more than 1 hour before eventually resuming and reaching the chequered flag after nearly 3 hours.
